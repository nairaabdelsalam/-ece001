<h2>Incredible Artificial Intelligence Facts</h2><p>AI is used in various fields that we have today: business, medicine, sales, market analysis, and so many more. Nowadays we want (most!) things to happen faster… Automation is what drives us forward and is what AI has been primarily conceived for. 

However, various other industries have seen the benefit and in a way transformed artificial intelligence to suit their needs.

Whether we want to admit it or not AI doesn’t always have the noblest causes. Artificial intelligence usage stats reveal that the business industry has adopted it the most and has integrated it into various markets. 

It is not only used to increase sales but also to develop products and services. The main point of doing business is making products and services more attractive to customers, and artificial intelligence is one way to do so.</p>
