  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> Voice Assistant</td>
    <td>Many of us use voice assistants for several purposes—shop, search the web for information, schedule appointments, and many other things. The voice assistant that’s disrupting the market is Amazon’s Alexa, which has already found a place in many of our houses. Built with a conversational AI platform, Alexa reacts and responds to human queries more naturally. 

In this application, conversational AI

Makes powerful computer applications easier to use and accessible to people
Interprets speech from anywhere in the house, making Alexa an innovative product</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>IBM’s Watson</td>
    <td>IBM’s Watson is a cognitive AI and machine learning application, which is employed by many organizations across various industries such as healthcare, banking, eCommerce, finance, and much more. Built with the latest innovations in machine learning, Watson is an open, multi-cloud platform that enables you to automate the AI lifecycle. By freeing your staff from mundane tasks, you can encourage your employees to focus on more important work. Also, you can anticipate business outcomes, while revamping your practices and workflows.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> <td>Autonomous Cars </td>
  <td>Lately, autonomous vehicles are gaining traction and Tesla has evolved to be the frontrunner with its AI-powered autonomous cars running smoothly on the streets.

Tesla’s AutoPilot feature powered by self-predictive capabilities makes it stand out from the other self-driving tech manufacturers. Tesla’s self-driving system is one of the most important artificial intelligence applications.

In this application, artificial intelligence is harnessed to

Build a neural network — a system of data, sensors, CPUs, hardware, and software—that processes information and adapts like a human.
Provide over the air service </td> </tr>
<tr> <td>Microsoft’s Cortana </td>
<td>Microsoft’s Cortana was designed to compete with other voice assistants in the market such as Google Assistant, Alexa, and Siri. Cortana is a personal productivity assistant that comes with almost all the latest Microsoft products. 

Microsoft is making efforts in optimizing and improving Cortana in different ways. Taking steps in this direction, the company has acquired Semantic Machines, a relatively new AI-based startup. The acquisition will help Microsoft to design a similar intelligent assistant like Cortana </td> </tr>
<tr>
<td>5. Online Television Programming Model </td>
<td>Until a couple of years ago, entertainment companies were not aware of our likes. But, now, Netflix has emerged as a gamechanger in the TV industry, enhancing our experience. 

In this application, artificial intelligence is used to

Learn and predict users’ behavior
Segment shows and channels based on the user’s likes and past interactions, feeding them exactly what they expect
Netflix employs predictive analytics to analyze and deliver personalized content to its viewers. It analyzes customers’ reactions to movies and shows as well as their past behavior toward the content. As more and more viewers use the platform and artificial intelligence data sets grow, the system becomes more accurate and smarter. 

The company has been successful in adopting artificial intelligence in its operations. This way, the online platform has improved the consumer experience and built a relationship of trust with the customers </td></tr>
